## What is Modern Portfolio?

Modern Portfolio is an advanced portfolio infrastructure designed for developers to present their projects, technical skills, and professional experience in accordance with modern web standards.

This project is not just a visual showcase.
It is built heavily on performance, SEO, modularity, and sustainability.

The infrastructure is built upon the Next.js App Router architecture and is based on modern web application principles.

## Architectural Features

### Next.js App Router Infrastructure

* SEO-friendly page generation
* Server & Client component support
* Dynamic routing structure
* High-performance rendering system

Every project has its own dedicated detail page with a unique URL structure.
This setup enhances both the user experience and search engine performance.

## Multilingual Support (Internationalization – i18n)

The system is designed with a natively multilingual structure.

* Separate content files for each language
* Dynamic language routing system
* Adding a new language is as simple as creating a new content file

Language expansion is entirely possible without making any changes to the codebase.

## JSON-Based Project Management

Each project is added to the system as an independent JSON file.

* Unlimited project support
* Add content without altering code
* Block-based dynamic rendering system
* Automatic component matching based on content type

This structure makes the project fully manageable without requiring deep technical knowledge.

# Supported Content Blocks

The system operates entirely through a `contentBlocks` structure.

### Type 0 — Text Block

Title, subtitle, and detailed description content.

### Type 1 — Image

Single image with a description area.

### Type 2 — Video

Video presentation with poster support.

### Type 3 — Gallery

Support for multiple images and descriptions.

### Type 4 — Multi-Code / Content

Display multiple code snippets or text blocks using a tabbed structure.

Thanks to this structure, the portfolio can deliver rich content both technically and visually.
